In particular,\nwe will ask on our ticket data form if you’re still willing to attend if our team decides we\ncannot make the physical event work. We will outline what the digital event will look like in\nfuture blog posts as we map out what a great digital Rust conference would look like.\n\nWe would love to meet you all again – or make your acquaintance – in person in Q4 2020;\nbut if that turns out not to be feasible, it would still be great to bring our community together\nfor an online Rust festival. We hope you will RustFest with us."}}}
