Of course the talks will also be recorded and be available after the conference.\\nThe Call for Participation will be similar to the ones in the previous years, where we will start with a blind phase followed by a second round in which a part of the team will see your names.\\n\\nWe want you to speak at RustFest and explicitly encourage new speakers to talk about their projects, ideas & experiences.\\nWe will provide further details on the CfP process in the coming weeks.\\n\\nTechnical details\\n\\nOver the next weeks we will test different setups.\\nAll talks will be streamed and recorded and we will help with the technical setup.\\nYou can give the talk from the coziness of your home, no travel required.\\n\\nCfP for workshops\\n\\nWorkshops have always been part of RustFest.\\nBringing them online will be a harder task, but we will try to do just that.\\nWe are looking into how to make workshops reliable, accessible and fun for everyone.\\n\\nCurrently, we are testing good formats with the ZÃ¼rich and Berlin meetups.\\n\\nSo we will have a second CfP for the workshops once we decide on a specific format.\\nIf you already have an idea for a workshop format or content that can work online, please approach us via email: team@rustfest.eu.\\n\\nWhat are we looking for?\\n\\nWe are looking for proposals that include, but are not limited to:\\n\\n\\n  How to stay connected in your part of the Rust community?\\n    \\n      Do you reach out to new people?\\n    \\n  \\n  How do you learn about useful crates?\\n  Show off your cool feature/crate/contribution\\n  Are you able to integrate Rust in your day job or did you run into obstacles? And how was the experience?\\n\\n\\nOr to make it even shorter: What have you learned (with Rust)?\\n\\nWhat to do in the meantime?\\n\\nWhile in-person events are still not possible we would like to suggest to follow these meetup-groups that are organizing online meetups and that you are able to attend from the comfort of your own home.\\n\\nFeel free to contact them if you would like to present a subject or talk about Rust.\\n\\n\\n  Berlin\\n  Netherlands\\n  ZÃ¼rich\\n\\n\\nLarger events are listed on timetill.rs with rusty days coming up next.\\n\\nSpeaker preparations\\n\\nIf you plan to submit a talk or a workshop for this or any other conference, why not record yourself talking about something for 5 minutes.\\nThis will allow you to see how the recording quality is.\\n\\nPro Tip: If you want to invest in something, start with brighter lights.\\nBuying any LED bulb (usually with the E27 fitting) with more than 1000 lumen and a warm colour (~2700 Kelvin) will probably improve quality more than a fancy webcam will.\\nPlus you can use the bulb as a normal light too.\\n\\n\\n    \\n      \\n    \\n\\n    \\n      Save the date: November 7th & 8th\\n      RustFest Global\\n      An online community conference!
