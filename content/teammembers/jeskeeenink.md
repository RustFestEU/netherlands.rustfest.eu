Jeske Eenink’s experience stems from FinTech where she builds meaningful relationships that drive long-term value. She loves to connect, learn and find opportunities for collaboration. She is in charge of Partners & Relations at Dusk Network: an open source blockchain infrastructure that businesses use to tokenize financial instruments and automate complex processes. Rust’s performance, safety characteristics, and community ecosystem make Rust an obvious choice for Dusk Network’s development of modern cryptographic systems.
